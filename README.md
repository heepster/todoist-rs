# Todoist Sync API

A Rust library for Todoist's Sync API.

This project has been forked from [here](https://github.com/ishehadeh/todoist-rs) because:
  * Some of Todoist's and Rust's APIs have changed
  * I'm working on another project that depends on this and it just makes it a whole lot easier having my own fork

Currently, this library has been updated for:
  * Todoist Sync version 8
  * Rust edition 2021
